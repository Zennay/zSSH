# zSSH

zSSH is a **standalone security-first remote operations project**. zCloud is its control-plane/dashboard integration, not its parent project.

## Current milestone

**M0 — Genesis + portfolio registration.**

This branch proves the smallest safe foundation:

- remote MCP endpoint at `/mcp`;
- development bearer authentication;
- `zssh_server_info`, `zssh_run_safe`, `zssh_exec`, `zssh_read_file`, and `zssh_write_file`;
- non-root startup guard;
- command timeout and output limits;
- configured filesystem roots;
- secret redaction in tool output and audit data;
- JSONL audit trail;
- raw shell disabled by default; command classification is audit/UX metadata, not the security boundary;
- Node unit tests for classification, redaction, and path boundaries.

## Project ownership

**Canonical source:** `Zennay/zSSH`.

zSSH has its own mission, roadmap, handoff, release lifecycle, security gates, and project identity. It is not a zCloud or HaxLab subproject.

zCloud only:
- registers zSSH as a first-class project in `projects.json`;
- displays its status/progress;
- may provide shared portfolio/control-plane infrastructure where useful.

HaxLab has no zSSH source or deployment responsibility.

## Architecture direction

```
ChatGPT plugin
    |
    v
zSSH remote MCP gateway
    |
    v
pairing / auth / policy
    |
    v
paired target agent
    |
    +-- Linux user
    +-- scoped sudo
    +-- files / systemd / git
```

M0 runs the gateway and execution adapter together to keep the proof small. M2 splits the target agent boundary and adds pairing/revocation. Production must not depend on storing users' SSH private keys in the gateway.

## Local development

Requires Node 20+.

```bash
cd zssh
npm install
cp .env.example .env
# export values from .env in your preferred way
npm test
npm start
```

The server binds to `127.0.0.1` by default. Put TLS/reverse proxy or a development tunnel in front of it rather than binding the M0 process directly to the public internet.

## Policy

`ZSSH_EXEC_MODE=disabled` is the default for raw shell. Full raw shell remains an explicit trusted/disposable-target mode and command classification is never treated as an authorization boundary.

For normal M1 inspection, `zssh_run_safe` uses a fixed read-only binary allowlist and `spawn(..., { shell: false })`, so user arguments are passed as argv instead of being interpreted by a shell. The default allowlist is `uptime`, `whoami`, `id`, `uname`, `pwd`, `df`, and `free`; operators may reduce it further with `ZSSH_SAFE_PROGRAMS`.

Production hardening still requires a dedicated service account, scoped sudo/capabilities, stronger approval semantics, rate limiting, OAuth-compatible user auth, agent pairing, and review against current ChatGPT plugin requirements.

## ChatGPT integration status

OpenAI's current plugin documentation uses remote MCP over streamable HTTP. Public submission requires a stable public HTTPS endpoint. Development bearer auth in M0 is temporary; production authentication and public submission are later milestones.

## Repository migration

The original bootstrap lived temporarily under `Zennay/zCloud/zssh/`. The standalone repository is now authoritative. Temporary HaxLab runner transport scripts were migrated into `ops/` for traceability; HaxLab itself is no longer part of zSSH's source or deployment ownership.
